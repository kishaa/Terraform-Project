A command 

terraform import <terraform_reference_id> <azure_resource_id>

 needs to be executed from powershell from the terrafrom directory

if you are trying to import a resource group then belwo would be the command
 terraform import azurerm_resource_group.az-resource-group /subscriptions/#########################/resourceGroups/NetworkWatcherRG

Once the resource is imported you could see the changes in .tfstate file. Later you need to update that tf file as per your resource.
